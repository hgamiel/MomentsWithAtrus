# PoemsFromAtrus
Taking random sentences Atrus has said from Myst and turning them into prose.

This is a project I started to help with learning Python since I'm a C++ gal.

## Instructions
1. Run "python atrus.py" via the command line. (Make sure you have Python installed!)
2. A poem is spit out in the console and into the output.txt file.
3. That is all!

## Branches
