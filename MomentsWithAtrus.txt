---#JustAtrusThings---

Well, I've removed the remaining undamaged books
from the library and placed them in the
places of protection
I could see the greed growing in them;
Oh, but the red and blue books, those
were different
I fear that my long delay
may have already had a catastrophic impact on
the world in which my wife, Catherine, is
now being held hostage
